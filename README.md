## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Button does not appear

- Check that the extension is enabled (`chrome://extensions/`)
- Check the Developer Console (F12) for errors

### Presets cannot be inserted
- Try refreshing the page
- Try writing in a new tweet (not a reply)
- If it still doesn't work, try restarting Chrome

### Icons are not displaying
- Check that you have the `images/` folder with PNG files
- Try reloading the extension (refresh button on `chrome://extensions/`)

## 📝 Notes
